        <p> <em>The Truman Show</em> was very innovative and unique at the time it was made; there wasn’t much other media that was similar to it. As technology progressed, the message in <em>The Truman Show</em> became more and more relatable and important, with many more similarities in the real world and other media. </p> 
        <p>   With technology and media progressing at a rapid rate, what was meant as an unrealistic, slightly dystopian movie has actually started to become true. There are now a few shows where the main character doesn’t know that they are part of a show, examples of this are The Joe Shmo Show and Jury Duty. In both of these shows everyone but the main character is a paid actor who creates weird or funny situations for the main character. In Jury Duty, Ronald Gladden is called to Jury Duty but he is unaware that the case he is a juror for is made up. This is extremely similar to <em>The Truman Show</em> in that the main character is a regular person in a scripted environment. Although this is on a much smaller scale than <em>The Truman Show</em>, it still shows that media companies are powerful enough to create “fake realities”.

            The Truman Show makes me realize that I view many advertisements without thinking about it, and the amount of ads that I see would be considered crazy when the movie came out. In The Truman Show, there are many advertisements made by characters like Meryl and the audience is used to seeing these advertisements like I am.

            <em>The Truman Show</em> is similar to the world in that the media has a lot of power and influence over us. In <em>The Truman Show</em>, Truman’s life is completely controlled by the media. Everything that happens to him is scripted and Christof uses these scripted events to control Truman’s life (e.g. the boat incident so that Truman can’t leave the island). The media can do the same thing in real life although much more subtle. We consume so much information and a lot of it can be manipulated to push an agenda. Certain news companies with political agendas can create false articles which changes our views of the world.
