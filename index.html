        <p> The film <em>The Truman Show</em>, released June 5th 1998, directed by Peter Weir shows that the media is extremely powerful and can control peopleâ€™s perception of truth and will manipulate the truth in order to push their agendas. The main character of this film, Truman, is unaware that he is part of a television show and that his life is being broadcasted every hour of the day. Everybody that Truman thinks he knows is an actor being told what to say by Christof, the director of the show. Throughout the movie, Truman begins to realize that something is off, and he tries to discover more about the truth and escape the island he is trapped on. This film explores many themes, including the power of media and the effect media can have on us.</p>
