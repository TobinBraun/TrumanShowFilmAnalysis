        <h2 class="title">Essential Question: How does this film affect our opinions of media?</h2>
        <p> The purpose of the film The Truman Show is undoubtedly to criticize the media industry and the control it has over us, but is this film enough to lessen the effect media has over us? Since this movie has been made, media companies have only gained more influence in our daily lives. Now, media can be found almost everywhere; news can be found on the radio, and advertisements can be found on billboards and all over the internet. The purpose of these advertisements is to convince as many people as possible to buy the product, even if . In The Truman Show, there are also advertisements all around Seahaven, as Christof said: “That's true. Everything on the show is for sale. Actors’ wardrobes, food products, to the very homes they live in.” (The Truman Show directed by Peter Weir). If The Truman Show has generated “the gross national product of a small country” from product placement alone, that means that the advertisements are working very well and are successfully manipulating people to buy the products. The people who watch The Truman Show are clearly overly influenced by the media they consume, which is likely a message to the viewers of the movie to think critically about the goals of the media they are consuming.
</p><p>
There is clearly a message within The Truman Show that is against product placement and people getting influenced by media they consume. Now, the media is so embedded in our lives that most people who watch this movie may watch this movie without changing anything. At the time this movie was released, it was an over exaggeration of how much advertising there is, clearly criticizing the advertisements at the time, but as time went on, this has become more realistic, and it isn’t as much of an exaggeration anymore, and people may not realize it is criticizing advertising. This movie may have been a powerful criticism of media and advertising when it was released, but now society has become so desensitized to large amounts of advertisements that it is unlikely that this movie will make anybody think differently about media now.</p>
