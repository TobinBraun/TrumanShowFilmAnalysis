    <p><em>The Truman Show</em> directed by Peter Weir represents a dystopian future where the media has an incredible amount of power and influence over the rest of society. I believe that this movie is meant to criticize media companies at the time, but the film ended up being a surprisingly accurate representation of modern modern media. According to an Peter Weir in an interview; “I had no idea the film foreshadowed Reality TV, or that it would come in recent years to touch on the old philosophical question, ‘What is reality?’” (Weir, Peter. Interview with ACMI). In <em>The Truman Show</em>, Christof and the producers of the show want to hide the truth from Truman that he is part of a television show because if Truman found out and wanted to leave the show, they would lose out on an incredible amount of money. Christof builds an entire city to keep the secret from Truman, and even though this city is completely fake and the people in it follow a script, it takes Truman almost thirty years to realize the truth. From the eyes of Truman and the people watching <em>The Truman Show</em>, this place is almost real. This shows that media can create lies so big that they can almost become the truth. In modern news and media, there are often inconsistencies with the truth, whether on purpose or not, that can create massive misconceptions for the thousands or millions of people that read it. </p>
<p> <em>The Truman Show</em> is similar to modern media in that almost all media is either trying to make money, push an agenda or both. <em>The Truman Show</em> does this by using product placement, they get money for trying to make their viewers purchase certain products. Many companies may compromise telling the truth when the truth is in the way of their agendas, the same way the truth was hidden from Truman so that Christof could continue <em>The Truan Show</em>. </p>
